Bachelor Thesis: Application of Data Mining Methods for Customer Clustering
## Abstract
Knowing its customers is essential for a companyâ€™s success. Esp. in the age of e-commerce, where customers became just rows of lists, it is important to target them more individually. The traces buyers leave in an online-store, allow detailed insights on their habits how they interact with an organization. Their purchase history contains all transactional data to build meaningful customer segments. These segments allow more targeted communication and actions towards customers.

The motivation behind this thesis is to investigate the value of clus- tering in the machine learning/data mining context for customer seg- mentation. Classical database marketing methods are combined with data mining tools. Data mining techniques can be used to create the segments automatically. The outcome shows that machine learning can be applied successfully for the needs of small and medium orga- nizations and can help in handling a growing customer base.
